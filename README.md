# Introduction_to_Computational_NeuroScience
Lab projects in Introduction to Computational NeuroScience, 2024 Fall, Peking University.
## Lab 1: Dynamics of Hodgkin-Huxley Model
We simulated Hodgkin-Huxley model (implemented an active point neuron model) in NEURON, investigated action potentials and relevent ion channels.
## Lab 2: Dendritic Computation
In the spatial-extended neurons, action potentials initiatedÂ in the axon can backpropagate into dendritic trees. We investigated principal mechanism of bAPs.
For discussion part, we simulated a Purkinje cell model, tried to verify ion channels deficiency in ataxia.
## Lab 3: CMSA Network
We modeled visual cortex based on LIF. We changed critical parameters (We, Wi, rp) and checked change of states, and saw each state's response to stimuli.
## Lab 4: Continuous Attractor Neural Network
We simulated continuous attractor neural network in brainpy, checked its response to input bump, then we further simulated CANN with spike frequency adaptation(SFA) and see its anticipative tracking of moving input.
For discussion part, we modeled coupled CANN of place cells and grid cells, investigated place cells' decode performance in the absence and presence of grid cells.
## Final: Noise Impact Analysis in Coupled CANN
Based on Lab 4 discussion, we continued to investigate whether and how noise influence network of grid cells and place cells.
